				V1			V2			V3
Part A		0m11.297s	1m13.484s	1m13.953s
Part C 02	0m5.906s	0m23.656s	0m20.422s
Part C 03	0m6.016s	0m10.469s	0m9.828s


PartA:
	The V1 has the shortest time among three of these, this is because it did all the ting inside the main and saved 
	time from use function calls.
	
Part C 02:
	With -O2 option for comply, all version of code is full Optimize, now the V2 and V3 is fast too, but still slower 
	than the V1. 

Part C 03:
	The time for V1 remain close with -O2, but the time for V2 and V3 is halfed and is also closed to V1.
